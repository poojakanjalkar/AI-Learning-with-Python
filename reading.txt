Teacher: Good morning, have you completed the assignment I gave last week?
Student: Good morning, ma'am. Yes, but I struggled with understanding recursion.
Teacher: Recursion can be tricky. Did you focus on the base case?
Student: I tried, but I didnâ€™t fully get how it stops infinite calls.
Teacher: The base case acts as a stopping point.
